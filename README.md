# marketplace-webapp

This is a simple marketplace app using PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS and SQLite3 for the database.

More details about the functioning of the app can be found in "Marketplace Webapp Guide.pdf"
This also contains existing customer and vendor user login information (test accounts I have created)

To run this app locally, download the repository, navigate to the directory and run " php -S localhost:XXXX " 
to start the app on the built-in php server.
